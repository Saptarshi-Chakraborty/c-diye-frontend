> **Background:** One of the professors in our college had a crush on C language and always tells us to learn C. But as a college student we were primarily interested in Web Development and other types of languages. In our friends group, we always make fun of his talks saying that he will only be happy with web development if we can write it in C language. ðŸ˜‚
